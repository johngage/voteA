<li>Is there money enough and time enough to upgrade or replace the most vulnerable elements of today's election and voting systems? in the next five months before the primaries? or in the next twelve months in the runup to November, 2020?</li>
<li>What are those vulnerable elements, and how do I know if they are used where I vote? Or used in swing states or closely contested elections?</li>
