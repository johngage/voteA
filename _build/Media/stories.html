<li><strong>Ubiquituous</strong>: 9,000 election districts; 15,000 water districts in California;</li>
<li><strong>Highly skewed</strong>: a few very big ones, a huge majority very small ones</li>
<li><strong>Ostensibly apolitical</strong>, but fundamentally political; viz Flint</li>
<li><strong>Boring</strong>, hard to explain why a power system failed (except PG&amp;E) or a water system failed (Flint); but, instant understanding of impact on lives when failures occur. Leads to stories on how to prevent failures in the future.<strong>But</strong>, these stories are rarely followed up; news organizations move on to the next big thing. That's what <em>news</em> means.</li>
<li>So, move beyond <strong>short news cycle</strong> to <em>continuous news cycle.</em></li>
<li><strong><em>This is the central idea of continuous data journalism</em></strong>. <strong>Automated, continuous coverage</strong>, with crowd-sourced local expertise using the same evaluative templates.</li>
<li><em>Think of this as building a logistics or industrial maintenance system, but for facts.</em></li>

<li>Pick representative districts, representative people, cover over time. Recurrent updates. Find compelling people. Later, bring them together, once audience has built for their stories.</li>
<li>Provide overall template evaluating how a district is doing (technology, costs,performance, training, bang for the buck, competence)</li>
<li>Build reporting infrastructure nation-wide in every district using NBC standard evaluation template:<ul>
<li>High school newspapers and video reporters (now streaming on Youtube) equipped with NBC templates</li>
<li>Higher ed (community colleges, colleges, universities) newspapers building data (Jupyter Notebooks) for every voting district<ul>
<li>Affiliate, O&amp;O teams holding regional summits to build NBC grassroots coverage</li>
<li>Use local coverage of local election machinery and institution to build local history of elections:who did what when.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Partner with high school and community college faculty to teach course on data journalism, using election data as core assignment material<ul>
<li>Use NBC local templates as foundations for a sequence of homework assignments in data science classes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create local NBC annual prize event (Data Journalism Emmy) for student, non-traditional coverage of local elections<ul>
<li>Use NBC on-air talent to create a three-hour EdX course on how to build election-related, or infrastructure-related podcast and videoblog</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Partner with popular technology vehicles: Popular Science, Popular Mechanics, hundreds of websites and podcasts, to do the local investigatory work.</li>
<li>Create NBC Investigatory Data ethical standards, publish them.  Similar to Fact Checking guidelines, but for technical subjects of infrastructure.</li>
<li>Use the hundreds of Ethics in Data courses blossoming on the thousands of campuses now teaching Data Science.</li>
