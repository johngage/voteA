<li><strong>Ubiquituous</strong>: 9,000 election districts; 15,000 water districts in California;</li>
<li><strong>Highly skewed</strong>: a few very big ones, a huge majority very small ones</li>
<li><strong>Ostensibly apolitical</strong>, but fundamentally political; viz Flint</li>
<li><strong>Boring</strong>, hard to explain why a power system failed (except PG&amp;E) or a water system failed (Flint); but, instant understanding of impact on lives when failures occur. Leads to stories on how to prevent failures in the future.<strong>But</strong>, these stories are rarely followed up; news organizations move on to the next big thing. That's what <em>news</em> means.</li>
<li>So, move beyond <strong>short news cycle</strong> to <em>continuous news cycle.</em></li>
<li><strong><em>This is the central idea of continuous data journalism</em></strong>. <strong>Automated, continuous coverage</strong>, with crowd-sourced local expertise using the same evaluative templates.</li>
<li><em>Think of this as building a logistics or industrial maintenance system, but for facts.</em></li>

<li>Daily profile of a registrar: rural, urban, swing district, historically Jim Crow district, previously-sanctioned district.</li>
<li><p>Follow five registrars for the next year, checking in weekly to hear their progress in maintaining and improving the integrity of their office</p>

<li>What challenges they face</li>
<li>What they have to do to get adequate resources</li>
<li>How they recruit and train their core staff, and prepare for rapid recruitment for recounts and election day</li>
<li>How they navigate the regulatory and legal environment. Exemplary case: huge fight this week in Kentucky, captured by affiliate <a href="https://www.lex18.com">WLEX: NBC coverage of meltdown fight between Secretary of State and incompetent Election Administrator</a></li>
