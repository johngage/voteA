## How to build the system

How can ethical journalism help an American citizen understand how our election systems work, how our systems can be improved, and how we can decide to trust the results?

Our best way to answer that question is to **observe these systems at work, continuously**, throughout the process, **assess performance, and report the results**.

This site proposes several ways to **build a national continuous news network** to examine our critical national infrastructures.

As we develop methods to examine our critical **election systems**, those same methods may be applied to America's other critical infrastructures, those controlling **power, water, information, transportation and financial systems**.

Call it **_continuous, open, visible, scalable data journalism_**.

**_We propose to use our most critical democracy infrastructure, our election system and the data it generates, as the foundation for fact-based, local news in every community in the country._**

Where do we find people in every jurisdiction to build the data and perform the local jurisdiction analysis?

Today, **thousands of data science faculty members** are hunting for relevant data sets and relevant analytic frameworks to assign to their students as homework.  Build a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing data from any voting jurisdiction, and any academic institution in that jurisdiction will use it.

How many students become potential partners? **Hundreds of thousands of students** are taking the new Data Science courses today.


Today's partisan environment, amplified by unethical journalism, may destroy our trust in our election results. Can we build a common understanding of how to verify the integrity of our democracy?

Can post-election audits of the results of an election establish to the satisfaction of all that the results were fairly decided, and reflect the actual vote?

And how do we build a consensus on the integrity, the good faith and honesty of the millions of Americans who will participate in carrying out the processes and procedures of the election?  Our registrars, our election boards, our technical staff, our volunteers in fire stations and post offices and schools across the country?
