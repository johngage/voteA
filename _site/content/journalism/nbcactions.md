  2. National journalism associations
  3. Retired journalists, statisticians
  4. National engineering societies: IEEE, ACM, AWWS

### Use traditional beat reporter structure at national and affiliate level, but add more local stories, and recruit new local sources and data to update them regularly.
- Pick representative districts, find representative people, cover over time. Recurrent updates, maybe bi-weekly. Build inventory of compelling people. Later, bring them together physically, to exchange stories, once audience is built for their stories.
- Provide overall template evaluating how a district is doing (technology, costs,performance, training, bang for the buck, competence)
- Build reporting infrastructure nation-wide in every district using NBC standard evaluation template:
  - High school newspapers and video reporters (now streaming on Youtube) equipped with NBC templates
  - Higher ed (community colleges, colleges, universities) newspapers building data (Jupyter Notebooks) for every voting district
- Affiliate, O&O teams holding regional summits to build NBC grassroots coverage
  - Use local coverage of local election machinery and institution to build local history of elections:who did what when.
  - Partner with high school and community college faculty to teach course on data journalism, using election data as core assignment material
      - Use NBC local templates as foundations for a sequence of homework assignments in data science classes
  - Create local NBC annual prize event (Data Journalism Emmy) for student, non-traditional coverage of local elections
      - Use NBC on-air talent to create a three-hour EdX course on how to build election-related, or infrastructure-related podcast and videoblog
  - Partner with popular technology vehicles: Popular Science, Popular Mechanics, hundreds of websites and podcasts, to do the local investigatory work.
  -   Create NBC Investigatory Data ethical standards, publish them.  Similar to Fact Checking guidelines, but for technical subjects of infrastructure.
  -  Use the hundreds of Ethics in Data courses blossoming on the thousands of campuses now teaching Data Science.
