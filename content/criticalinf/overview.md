# Critical Infrastructure Journalism

### How can news organizations report on the functioning of hundreds of millions of semi-autonomous systems that control our power grids, our water systems, our smart buildings, our traffic systems, our networks, our transportation grid, our medical devices, our financial systems, our voting systems and more--America's critical infrastructure?


This site outlines how to develop  **Continuous Data Journalism**,  a secure, real-time, continuous flow of critical infrastructure data to news and journalism organizations, enabling a new kind of responsible public oversight, without enabling new attacks or exploits of technical weaknesses.



This site considers a small, but vital area of our national infrastructure: **the integrity of our voting systems**.  As we develop forms of journalism to better cover this subset of our infrastructure, we hope to build tools for better coverage of all infrastructure.

Journalistic coverage of infrastructure faces a fundamental challenge: **by describing vulnerabilities, do we enable attacks, or do we enable those fighting against attacks?**

This goes to the core of journalistic ethics: how will a story affect those it reports about?  There is no simple answer, there is no way to guarantee lack of harm, there is no way to guarantee accuracy and justice.  There is only the belief that facts enable better decisions, open decisions are more often right than hidden decisions, good democratic decisions require an informed public and an informed government, decisions are measured by results, and results are openly reported.

This site argues that we can only build resistance to attacks if we know our vulnerabilities.

Journalism's responsibility is not to fix our critical infrastructure, but to build public understanding of what systems we have, what we need to do to harden them, what that will cost, and what the consequences might be if we do not.


### Start by building a new way to cover America's critical voting infrastructure for the 2020 election.

These systems are public, deployed now, managed by over 10,000 jurisdictions and by over 50,000 public employees charged with maintaining the integrity of the 2020 elections. But, these systems are under attack, today.

Billions of dollars are being spent, today, to improve the integrity of our election systems. The majority of jurisdictions have run out of time, however, to implement upgrades or hardened systems. However, introduction of risk-limiting audits in a growing number of jurisdictions may allow our 2020 election systems to test and establish the integrity of our elections. News organizations must find a way to incorporate these new capabilities in their coverage.

And that coverage can develop new sources and methods to broaden our understanding.

### Use what we develop to report on elections to improve coverage of the rest of America's infrastructure

Today's news stories of cyber attacks, power and water system malfunctions, security breaches of massive data bases containing personal information, misuse of massive surveillance systems, and attacks on the integrity of the machinery of our voting systems share common characteristics:

- Episodic
- Fragmentary
- Uneven in technical understanding
- Unrelated to each other

News organizations have developed specialized, highly technical beat coverage of cybersecurity issues, with sub-domains covering personal data privacy breaches, national security breaches, social network manipulations, algorithm-based decision systems, and the fragile and brittle nature of our networks.

We can build on this investment by massively broadening local coverage.
