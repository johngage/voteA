#Data Journalism for Critical Infrastructure

Our overall goal is to build a _DataCorps_ of 100,000 skilled practitioners, at least two in each relevant water district, sub-grid or grid district, fire district, police district or jurisdiction in the country, equipped with:
 - broad datasets covering every aspect of the local jurisdiction.
 - a diverse set of analytic tools to examine local data
 - personal acquaintance with local jurisdiction public officials, local laws and regulations, local political history and relationships, and local election machinery
 - acquaintance with all industrial, chemical, energy, nuclear, or other private industries building, maintaining, or owning infrastructure
 - personal acquaintance with all journalistic entities covering local infrastructure
 -aquaintance with groups that hack infratructure
 - acquaintance with national security entities with interest in cybersecurity, both defensive or offensive mission; acquaintance with competency and integrity of local police, fire, public works, and other infrastructure security groups
 - some certification of competence, integrity, and experience, from a local educational institution or a national group
 - links to all other _DataCorps_ analysts in their county, region, or state, to enable cross-jurisdictional analysis and comparison
