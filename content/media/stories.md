# Story Frameworks for continuous coverage

## How to generate continuous coverage of the state of America's election infrastructure?
### Same challenge for news organizations as in covering electric or water infrastructure:
  - **Ubiquituous**: 9,000 election districts; 15,000 water districts in California;
  - **Highly skewed**: a few very big ones, a huge majority very small ones
  - **Ostensibly apolitical**, but fundamentally political; viz Flint
  - **Boring**, hard to explain why a power system failed (except PG&E) or a water system failed (Flint); but, instant understanding of impact on lives when failures occur. Leads to stories on how to prevent failures in the future.**But**, these stories are rarely followed up; news organizations move on to the next big thing. That's what _news_ means.
  - So, move beyond **short news cycle** to _continuous news cycle._
  - **_This is the central idea of continuous data journalism_**. **Automated, continuous coverage**, with crowd-sourced local expertise using the same evaluative templates.
  - _Think of this as building a logistics or industrial maintenance system, but for facts._

### Use traditional beat reporter structure, but incorporate new ways to tell the story, new ways to recruit sources and data
- Pick representative districts, representative people, cover over time. Recurrent updates. Find compelling people. Later, bring them together, once audience has built for their stories.
- Provide overall template evaluating how a district is doing (technology, costs,performance, training, bang for the buck, competence)
- Build reporting infrastructure nation-wide in every district using NBC standard evaluation template:
  - High school newspapers and video reporters (now streaming on Youtube) equipped with NBC templates
  - Higher ed (community colleges, colleges, universities) newspapers building data (Jupyter Notebooks) for every voting district
    - Affiliate, O&O teams holding regional summits to build NBC grassroots coverage
    - Use local coverage of local election machinery and institution to build local history of elections:who did what when.
- Partner with high school and community college faculty to teach course on data journalism, using election data as core assignment material
  - Use NBC local templates as foundations for a sequence of homework assignments in data science classes
- Create local NBC annual prize event (Data Journalism Emmy) for student, non-traditional coverage of local elections
  - Use NBC on-air talent to create a three-hour EdX course on how to build election-related, or infrastructure-related podcast and videoblog
- Partner with popular technology vehicles: Popular Science, Popular Mechanics, hundreds of websites and podcasts, to do the local investigatory work.
-   Create NBC Investigatory Data ethical standards, publish them.  Similar to Fact Checking guidelines, but for technical subjects of infrastructure.
-  Use the hundreds of Ethics in Data courses blossoming on the thousands of campuses now teaching Data Science.

## Who runs our elections?
- Daily profile of a registrar: rural, urban, swing district, historically Jim Crow district, previously-sanctioned district.
- Follow five registrars for the next year, checking in weekly to hear their progress in maintaining and improving the integrity of their office
  - What challenges they face
  - What they have to do to get adequate resources
  - How they recruit and train their core staff, and prepare for rapid recruitment for recounts and election day
  - How they navigate the regulatory and legal environment. Exemplary case: huge fight this week in Kentucky, captured by affiliate [WLEX: NBC coverage of meltdown fight between Secretary of State and incompetent Election Administrator](https://www.lex18.com)
