# Reporter's questions to build baseline data for a jurisdiction for Election 2020

Goal: build a **Reporter Template** to capture the basic outline of a registration and voting system in a jurisdiction, with figures of merit.

Whether it's a high school student body election, a school board election, a city council election, a congressional election, or a Presidential election, common elements enable comparisons and rankings.

How can a reporter build a picture quickly, for any jurisdiction?
