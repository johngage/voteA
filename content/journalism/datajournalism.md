# Data Journalism for Elections

Our overall goal is to build a _DataCorps_ of 100,000 skilled practicioners, at least two in each voting jurisdiction in the country, equipped with:
 - broad datasets covering every aspect of the local jurisdiction.
 - a diverse set of analytic tools to examine local data
 - personal acquaintance with local jurisdiction public officials, local laws and regulations, local political history and relationships, and local election machinery
- acquaintance with all police, security and intelligence entities covering local infrastructure, at all levels

 - personal acquaintance with all journalistic entities covering local elections
 - some certification of competence, integrity, and experience, from a local educational institution or a national group
 - links to all other _DataCorps_ analysts in their county, region, or state, to enable cross-jurisdictional analysis and comparison

##Specific steps to build the curriculum, the data sets, the tools, and the relationships for _DataCorps_

###Curriculum
build on DS
Building journalism data science templates for the 50,000 students now taking data science courses

Thousands of data science faculty members are hunting for relevant data sets and relevant analytic frameworks to assign to their students as homework.  Build a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing data from any voting jurisdiction, and any academic institution in that jurisdiction will use it.

**This is the answer to the problem of recruiting data sources and data analyses from 10,000 voting jurisdictions.**
