## Building a new curriculum based on data science courses
- Building journalism data science templates for the 50,000 students now taking data science courses

Thousands of data science faculty members are hunting for relevant data sets and relevant analytic frameworks to assign to their students as homework.  Build a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing data from any voting jurisdiction, and any academic institution in that jurisdiction will use it.

**This is the answer to the problem of recruiting data sources and data analyses from 10,000 voting jurisdictions.**
