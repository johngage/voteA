## How to build the system

How can ethical journalism help an American citizen understand how our election systems work, how our systems can be improved, and how we can decide to trust the results?

Our best way to answer that question is by observing the elements of these systems at work, continuously, throughout the process, assessing performance, and reporting the results.

This site proposes several ways to build a national continuous news network to examine our critical national infrastructures. As we develop methods to examine our critical election systems, those same methods may be applied to America's other critical infrastructures, those controlling power, water, information, transportation and financial systems.

Call it _continuous, open, visible, scalable data journalism_.

We propose to use our most critical democracy infrastructure as the foundation for fact-based, local news.

Today's partisan environment, amplified by unethical journalism, may destroy our trust in our election results. Can we build a common understanding of how to verify the integrity of our democracy?

Can post-election audits of the results of an election establish to the satisfaction of all that the results were fairly decided, and reflect the actual vote?

And how do we build a consensus on the integrity, the good faith and honesty of the millions of Americans who will participate in carrying out the processes and procedures of the election?  Our registrars, our election boards, our technical staff, our volunteers in fire stations and post offices and schools across the country?
