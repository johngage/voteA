# Design a framework for continuous coverage stories, allowing continuous updates

## How to generate continuous coverage of the state of America's election infrastructure?
### Same challenge for news organizations as in covering electric or water infrastructure:
  - **Ubiquituous**: 10,000 election districts; 15,000 water districts in California;
  - **Highly skewed**: a few very big ones, a huge majority very small ones
  - **Ostensibly apolitical**, but fundamentally political; viz Flint
  - **Boring**, hard to explain why a power system failed (except PG&E) or a water system failed (Flint); but, instant understanding of impact on lives when failures occur. Leads to stories on how to prevent failures in the future.**But**, these stories are rarely followed up; news organizations move on to the next big thing. That's what _news_ means.
  - So, move beyond **short news cycle** to _continuous news cycle._
  - **_This is the central idea of continuous data journalism_**. **Automated, continuous coverage**, with crowd-sourced local expertise using the same evaluative templates.
  - _Think of this as building a logistics or industrial maintenance system, but for facts._

## Who runs our elections?
- Daily profile of a registrar: rural, urban, swing district, historically Jim Crow district, previously-sanctioned district.
- Follow five registrars for the next year, checking in weekly to hear their progress in maintaining and improving the integrity of their office
  - What challenges they face
  - What they have to do to get adequate resources
  - How they recruit and train their core staff, and prepare for rapid recruitment for recounts and election day
  - How they navigate the regulatory and legal environment. Exemplary case: huge fight this week in Kentucky, captured by affiliate [WLEX: NBC coverage of meltdown fight between Secretary of State and incompetent Election Administrator](https://www.lex18.com)
