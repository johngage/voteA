 What can be done now:
- Focus on swing states, pick 20 - 50 jurisdictions
- Find NBC stations that cover those jurisdictions; add 1 FTE Coordinator at each (split cost with affiliate)
- Reach out to all local newspapers, radio stations, twitter journalists to join in common pooled data initiative
- Recruit faculty at all higher ed, and high schools, teaching data science.
- Develop local data for their class assignments; assign schools to cover specific precincts or census tracts.

- Match NBC station locations to critical swing districts, and the students that live there
