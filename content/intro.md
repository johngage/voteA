Threats against the integrity of our elections challenge American democracy.

Today's partisan environment could destroy America's trust in our election systems.

In a media environment of outrage and false claims, how can we believe the results of an election were decided fairly?

Can we verify the integrity of our elections in a way that most Americans would trust? Specifically, can American journalism build a national common understanding of how to monitor the integrity of our democracy in an era of cynicism and attack?

On election day, news organizations now rely on voting counts from 9,000 jurisdictions. This is a proposal to build a parallel data system, utilizing the new data science curriculum, to bring thousands of data scientists into partnership with news organizations to build a new path to guaranteeing integrity.

What do we have to work with? [520,000 elected officials ](https://images.dailykos.com/images/134822/large/Elected_officials.png?1426881549) in the US know how they were elected.

This site explores the possibility of creating a new, decentralized network of data sources and data analysis to monitor our elections, joining national news organizations, local news organizations, and social media reporting entities with tens of thousands of data scientists, nationwide, in a common effort to acquire and analyze election system data.ss

This site explores how to shift from **episodic** news coverage to **continuous** coverage, utilizing new tools of data acquisition and data analysis.  From discrete to continuous.

Many efforts to detect and prevent attacks on our voting systems are underway, at a national, state, and local level.
The [US Election Assistance Commission (EAC)](https://www.eac.gov/payments-and-grants/hava-funds-state-chart-view/) has distributed almost $4 billion dollars to hundreds of jurisdictions; the Department of Homeland Security monitors and mentors hundreds of jurisdiction on hardening their systems; the National Security Agency, and the US CyberCommand are running training exercises to defend our election systems from threats of interference.

But American news organizations have a unique, independent capability and a special journalistic responsibility to publically report on the integrity of elections, whether government-run or privately-run.  All news organizations are designing their systems now to report on the 2020 election.

Here is the important convergence: **As American news organizations build their capabilities to report on the election, they can build, at the same time, elements of what America needs to _protect_ its election systems--a new, vast network of local sources, local data, and local analysis able to detect anomalies and irregularities.**

As election systems have come to rely almost entirely  on information technologies, new capabilities are inextricably joined with new vulnerabilities. Estimates range into the billions of dollars to update or replace voting systems in America's nine thousand voting jurisdictions to reach desirable levels of security.  Primary elections in 2020, and the general election in 2020 will run on antiquated and vulnerable equipment. Time and money have run out. There is no practical way to change the voting systems for the majority of these jurisdictions.

But we can build reporting systems, **news** systems, **data analysis** systems to significantly increase our trust in election results. These systems will require new initiatives by American news organizations, joined with new capabilities of data acquisition and analysis developed in the rapidly expanding world of data science. The expertise to do this lies in American companies, American universities, and American institutions devoted to national security.

This site outlines a workable approach to join these communities in a common effort for America's elections.
