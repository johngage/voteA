# Journalism and Vote2020

Fundamental journalistic integrity may be the most important element in how American voters view the validity of the highly contested 2020 elections.  In the next twelve months, continual examination of how we exercise democracy will be critical for trusting the result of the vote.

How can journalism help an American citizen understand how our election systems work, how our systems can be improved, and how we can decide to trust the results, by observing the elements of these systems at work, continuously, throughout the process?

Call it _continuous, open, visible data journalism_.

Today's partisan environment may destroy our trust in our election system. Can we build a common understanding of how to verify the integrity of our systems? Can we carry out post-election audits of the results of an election to establish to the satisfaction of all that the results were fairly decided?

And how do we build a consensus on the integrity of our elections, and on the good faith and honesty of the millions of Americans who will participate in carrying out the processes and procedures of the election?

## Will 9,000 US voting jurisdictions be able to safeguard their voting systems in 2020? Do they know how?
  - Is there money enough and time enough to upgrade or replace the most vulnerable elements of today's election and voting systems? in the next five months before the primaries? or in the next twelve months in the runup to November, 2020?
  - What are those vulnerable elements, and how do I know if they are used where I vote? Or used in swing states or closely contested elections?
  - What do we need to do to put in place new auditing systems to increase our trust in the accuracy of election results?
  - Can we harden our systems against tampering, and detect tampering when it occurs?  Which elements are easy to harden, and which elements are difficult?  What would it cost to improve systems for a 100,000-person city election, or for a 747,000-person Congressional Distict election?
  - What role should Federal agencies play in US elections? in local elections? What roles should US CyberCommand, NIST, DARPA, DHS, the EAC, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Justice play in strengthening our election systems?
  - What role can State Secretaries of State, or local Registrars or Election Commissions play in strengthening our election systems?
  - Who is doing a good job?  Who could do better?
